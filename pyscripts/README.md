# PyScripts
Various python scripts to dump data.

## Maven packaging analysis

The [packaging_analysis.py](packaging/packaging_analysis.py) contains the python scripts to convert the raw information from the database into meaningful data.
The data can be generated by simply running the python scripts.

### Prerequisites

- Python version 3.9 or above
- The connection to the database must be established as the scripts query the database.

###Methodology

After running the python scripts, all the data is stored into text files for all the research questions.
To generate graphs, the data from each text file should be copied to the _Analysis.xlsx_ file. This file can be found in
the dataset(ADD LINK TO DATASET). Make sure to copy the data starting from cell _A2_ in each sheet. This will automatically
update the other columns in the spreadsheet and also generate the graphs.
